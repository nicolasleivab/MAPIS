# MAPIS Architecture: A Modular and Isolated Frontend Development Approach

MAPIS (Model, Application, Presentation, Infrastructure, Services) is a modern architecture designed to address the increasing complexity of front-end applications like React. Over the past decade, front-end systems have grown from simple UI renderers to highly interactive and complex systems that handle substantial business logic, state management, and asynchronous operations. MAPIS provides a structured, modular approach that ensures maintainability and scalability for modern front-end development.

MAPIS organizes an application into five distinct layers, each with a dedicated responsibility:

- Model: This layer handles state management, data processing, and business logic. It governs the data lifecycle using React hooks, context APIs, and logic to handle complex state transformations.

- Application: Serving as the core orchestrator, the Application layer combines data, services, and UI components. It defines the structure of pages, routing, and high-level application logic, ensuring that the modules work together smoothly.

- Presentation: The Presentation layer is focused purely on rendering visual components. It includes reusable UI elements, global styles, and formatting logic. By keeping it decoupled from business logic, it ensures that components are modular and reusable.

- Infrastructure: This layer is responsible for the environment setup and build processes, housing configuration files for tools like Webpack, TypeScript, Docker, and linters. It provides the foundation for the app to run and be bundled, without handling application-specific logic.

- Services: Responsible for handling asynchronous operations and external communications, Services manages API calls, authentication, and interactions with external services. It decouples service interactions from the rest of the system and ensures clean API logic, as well as service-specific configurations.

### Benefits of MAPIS Architecture
Adaptability to Complexity: As front-end systems grow more complex, MAPIS provides a structured approach to handling intricate business logic, asynchronous operations, and UI rendering, helping developers navigate this complexity.

Separation of Concerns: By assigning clear responsibilities to each layer, developers can work on different aspects of the application without disrupting others. This modular approach enhances maintainability and makes the codebase easier to test.

Modular Scalability: MAPIS facilitates the easy addition or modification of features, with minimal impact on the rest of the application. Each layerâ€™s isolation allows for cleaner, more scalable code.

MAPIS is designed to meet the demands of modern front-end development, ensuring that projects remain flexible, maintainable, and scalable, even as they grow in complexity.
