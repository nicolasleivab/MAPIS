# MAPIS Architecture: A Modular and Isolated Frontend Development Approach

MAPIS (Model, Application, Presentation, Infrastructure, Services) is a modern architecture designed to address the increasing complexity of front-end applications like React. It is particularly well-suited for front-end monorepos, offering a clear structure to manage growing complexity while keeping development focused and manageable for small to medium-sized teams.

Over the past decade, front-end systems have evolved from simple UI layers to highly interactive, complex systems that handle substantial business logic, state management, and asynchronous operations. MAPIS provides a structured, modular approach that ensures maintainability and scalability for modern front-end development while adapting to the rise of smaller development teams and performance-boosting tools.

MAPIS organizes an application into five distinct layers, each with a dedicated responsibility:

- Model: This layer handles state management, data processing, and business logic. It governs the data lifecycle using React hooks, context APIs, and logic to handle complex state transformations.

- Application: Serving as the core orchestrator, the Application layer combines data, services, and UI components. It defines the structure of pages, routing, and high-level application logic, ensuring that the modules work together smoothly.

- Presentation: The Presentation layer is focused purely on rendering visual components. It includes reusable UI elements, global styles, and formatting logic. By keeping it decoupled from business logic, it ensures that components are modular and reusable.

- Infrastructure: This layer is responsible for the environment setup and build processes, housing configuration files for tools like Webpack, TypeScript, Docker, and linters. It provides the foundation for the app to run and be bundled, without handling application-specific logic.

- Services: Responsible for handling asynchronous operations and external communications, Services manages API calls, authentication, and interactions with external services. It decouples service interactions from the rest of the system and ensures clean API logic, as well as service-specific configurations.

### Benefits of MAPIS Architecture

- Adapted for Monorepos: MAPIS is optimized for front-end monorepos, making it easier to handle complex applications in a single repository. This is particularly beneficial for teams that don't need to manage complex microfrontends, as monorepos can consolidate development efforts while maintaining clear modularity.

- Adaptability to Complexity: As front-end systems grow more complex, MAPIS provides a structured approach to handling intricate business logic, asynchronous operations, and UI rendering. It helps developers navigate this complexity with ease, even as applications grow larger.

- Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a well-defined responsibility, allowing developers to work independently on different aspects of the application without disrupting other parts. This modular approach enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability.

- Shift Toward Monolithic Clients: With the rise of smaller development teams, there is increasing pressure to return to monolithic client architectures. Managing microfrontends can be overkill for smaller teams that don’t need the overhead of complex setups. Tools that boost productivity and performance now allow teams to build efficient and scalable monolithic clients, which in turn shortens development cycles and reduces complexity.

- Modular Scalability: MAPIS supports easy addition or modification of features with minimal impact on the rest of the application. Each layer’s isolation allows for clean, scalable codebases, which is especially important for smaller teams working with tight development schedules.

By following the MAPIS architecture, teams can take advantage of the benefits of monorepos and monolithic client development while maintaining the flexibility, scalability, and maintainability required in modern front-end applications. It ensures that projects remain efficient and productive, even as they grow in size and complexity.
